# connect4-3d
The game is connect 4, but in 3D space!

There are now a multitude of additional strategies to formulate 
when factoring not only connections on a single plane, but the 9 other diagonal 
and vertical wins that can be made.

Currently, the game has the search mechanics for determining a winner in 3D space along
with placing pieces. However, 3D graphics are currently being worked on in JavaFX
and hopes of adding a bot using a minimax algorithm and online network play are on the way!

Inshallah the game will be complete soon!
